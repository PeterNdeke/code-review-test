My thought about the code: The code  is OK. logics has no issues but it has some formatting issues, line space issues
and missing some PSR-2 coding standard. Infact, it is basically refactoring it to follow the best PSR-2 php coding standards
What i would do is to identify those coding standard issues, flaws, line space and indentation issues and fix them
